- Polynomial Curve Fitting is an example of Regression, a supervised machine learning algorithm.
- __End Goal of Curve Fitting__: We observe a real-valued input variable, $x$, and we intend to predict the target variable, $t$. Polynomial Curve fitting is a generalized term; curve fitting with various input variables, $x$, $y$, and many more.

We will see curve fitting on a synthetic dataset.

For the synthetic dataset, we will generate the data points from a function <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=sin{2 \pi}x" height="25" width="25"> with some random normal noise included.

```
## Imports
import warnings
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

## Set a seed
np.random.seed(0)

## Create Synthetic Dataset
x = np.linspace(0.0, 1.0, num=10)
t = (np.sin(2*np.pi*x)) + np.random.normal(0, 1, 10)

txt="Fig 1.1: Scatter plot of the observations with targets"
plt.scatter(x, t)
plt.xlabel("Observations, (x)")
plt.ylabel("Targets, (t)")
plt.title("Synthetic data points")

plt.show()
```
