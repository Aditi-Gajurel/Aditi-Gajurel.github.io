**Resume**

<!-- ðŸ“ƒ You can find my [Resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a20srnBPEXdMic148lRYL2j6VwIg_88H/view?usp=sharing) here. -->

By Profession, I am a Machine Learning Engineer, but it is a great title to bear, so I would prefer to be called a novice, fledgling learner whose interest mostly lies in Probabilistic and Statistical Machine Learning.

You might want to take a peek at my CV if you would like to know more. Thanks!
