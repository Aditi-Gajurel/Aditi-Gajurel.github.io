Hi, I am a Machine Learning Engineer, with 2+ years of Industry experience. My prime feilds of interest are Probabilistic Modeling, Statistical Learning, and Numerical Optimization. Besides academics, my quest to keep myself mentally updated tempts me to grab a book, blogs, podcasts, youtube videos.
